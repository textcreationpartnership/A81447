            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Saturday 15.</label> The Gate-house being a place very con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; mighty advantagious for us. Our Generall re≈øolved to storm the same, though it had a ≈øtrong work before it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>6</hi> Souldiers, for <hi>3</hi> ≈øhillings a piece, undertook to throw in Granadoes, and <hi>20</hi> men to carry Ladders for half a Crown a piece, &amp; a Commanded party of Foot to ≈øtorm, led on by Major <hi>Be≈øcoe,</hi> which accordingly they did as soon as <hi>8</hi> peice of Canon had given fire upon the Besieged, and the Granadoes did great execution the Ladders were placed with much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the Be≈øieged much dismaied, forced to quit ther‚Äîworks, &amp; flie into the Gate-house, one Granadoe kindled their Magazin, and blew up many of the Be≈øieged, the re≈øt were taken pri≈øoners, and ≈ølain; the pri≈øoners confest they were above a hundred in the Gate-house &amp; work, and few of them could escape, <hi>13</hi> at one place were pulled out the next day from under the Rubbi≈øh. This night the Be≈øieged indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to e≈øcape with their horse, Commanded by Sir <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Ga≈øcoign,</hi> and pa≈øt the River between the North-bridge &amp; middle Mill, and had the Miller for their Guide, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miller when he came int othe Clo≈øes, ran away, and the Pioneers after him, and our Centinels giving fire, the Be≈øieged retreated; The Suburbs was Fired in <hi>6</hi> or <hi>7</hi> places, which burnt in a most-dreadfull manner all night long, that the Town might be seen almo≈øt as well by night as by day, so great was the flame. And on Sunday the <hi>16.</hi> other Streets were set on fire, with de≈øign to con≈øume the whole Suburbs, but by the indu≈øtry of the Inhabitants &amp; Souldiers it was prevented. This day our Generall had certain Intelligence. That an Army of Scots under Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> had invaded the Kingdom &amp; joyned the Cavaliers under <hi>Langdale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Sunday 16.</label> Our Generall sent a Summons again to Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Town: The Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Lucas</hi> joyntly returned Answer (in writing) under their hands to our Generall. That if the Trumpeter came any more with such a Summons, they would hand him up. The Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then offered to the Souldiers, was. Liberty, and Pa≈ø≈øes to go to their severall homes, submitting to the Authority of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Munday 17.</label> Again more hou≈øes were fired towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North ≈øtreet, &amp; other places. This day our Generall had certain News brought him of the Surrender of <hi>Pembrook</hi> Town &amp; Ca≈øtle, <hi>Langhorn,</hi> and <hi>Poyer</hi> submitting their lives to mercy.</p>

               <p>

The Be≈øieged at night drew out their Horse at <hi>12</hi> of the clock, and afterwards at <hi>2</hi> of the clock in the morning to e≈øcape, but our men were in such readine≈øs they dur≈øt not advance.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Tuesday August 1.</label> A Cornet, Quarterma≈øter, Corporall, and one Trooper came away with their hor≈øes.</p>

This day the Mayor of <hi>Colche≈øter</hi> sent a Letter to the Gen. That the Inhabitants might come out, for that they had no provi≈øion, it being all ≈øeised by the Souldiers. Our Generall returned an≈øwer, He pittied their condition, but to grant that, was to make the Town hold out longer, and did not ≈øtand with his tru≈øt to permit it. This day we had the news of the killing &amp; di≈øpersing the Princes forces by some Hor≈øe and Foot of the Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> near <hi>Deale;</hi> and also of the regaining of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Ca≈øtle by Sir <hi>Arthur Ha≈øelrigg.</hi>

Answer was returned by Our Gen. that he hop'd in much le≈øs time than <hi>20</hi> days, to have the Town without Treaty. All things are preparing in Order to a ≈øtorm.</p>
               <p>
